# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-01)

**Core value:** "I deposit USDT, select my risk preference, and the system automatically finds opportunities across both strategies, opens positions, collects funding, exits when profitable, and I can see exactly how much each position earned."
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — spot-futures-exchange-expansion

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Spot-futures expansion before operational safety -- user Priority 1
- [Roadmap]: PP-04 grouped with analytics (Phase 4) not safety (Phase 3) -- it is a dashboard/data feature
- [Roadmap]: Phase 3 has no dependency on Phases 1-2 -- can be pulled forward if needed
- [Phase 01]: OKX cross-margin borrows via tdMode=cross + ccy=USDT (Futures mode implicit) instead of autoLoan API
- [Phase 03]: Cooldown uses injectable time parameter for deterministic testing
- [Phase 03]: Notifier does not gate on config; callers check EnablePerpTelegram
- [Phase 03]: API error counter fires at exactly count==3, not every subsequent failure

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Each remaining exchange (Binance, Gate.io, Bitget, OKX) will have unique margin API quirks -- budget for 3-5 adapter bugs per exchange (v0.22.44-49 precedent)
- npm lockfile update process needed before Phase 4 frontend work (charting libraries)
